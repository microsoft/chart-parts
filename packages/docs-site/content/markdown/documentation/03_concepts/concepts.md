## Key Concepts

In this section we will describe, at overview-level, the key concepts that are
used to create charts using chart-parts. These concepts will likely be familiar
to people with a background in data visualization, especially if they have used
mark-based visualization systems before.

## Scales

Scales are a construct that allow us to translate values from a source domain
into a target domain. Practically, what this means is that we can translate
values from our data into values that are shown to users, namely screen
coordinates, colors, etc...

In chart-parts, our scales are based on d3 scales, and assume basic familiarity
with how they operate.

Here are some resources regarding d3 scales that may be helpful:

- [d3-scale GitHub repository](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)
- [d3-scale-chromatic GitHub repository](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic)
- [_Introducing d3-scale_ by Mike Bostock](https://medium.com/@mbostock/introducing-d3-scale-61980c51545f)

### Scale Types

These are the basic scale types supported by the system. More details about
using and creating them can be found in the [Client APIs](/documentation/apis)
documentation section.

- **Quantitative**: _linear_, _log_, _pow_, _sequential_, _sqrt_, _time_, _utc_
- **Discrete**: _band_, _ordinal_, _point_

In **chart-parts**, each created scale has a name. This allows us to reference the
scale when we are defining [mark encodings](/documentation/concepts/marks).

### Defining Scales

```jsx
// React API
<LinearScale name="y" domain="data.amount" range={Dimension.Height} nice zero />
```

```js
// SceneBuilder API
linear('y')
  .domain('data.amount')
  .range(Dimension.Height)
  .nice()
  .zero(),
```

## Marks

_Marks_ are the fundamental building block, and visual unit of chart-parts,
and any _grammar-of-graphics_.

### Mark Parameterization

Marks often have multiple parameters to describe how they appear. For example,
to describe a rectangle, one needs at a minimum: (height, width, (x,y)
position, and color).

### Defining Marks

In our system, when we bind these parameters to our data, this is called an
_encoding_. When we encode a parameter, we create an instance of the mark for
each row in our data table, and parameterize the mark against that data
context.

```jsx
// React API
<Rect
  table="my-data"
  x={({ d, x }) => x(d.category)}
  height={({ d, y }) => y(d.amount)}
  y={0}
  width={30}
  fill="blue"
/>
```

```js
// SceneBuilder API
rect()
  .table('my-data')
  .encode({
    x: ({ d, x }) => x(d.category),
    height: ({ d, y }) => y(d.amount),
    y: 0,
    width: 30,
    fill: 'blue',
  })
```

In the above examples we specify an object where the keys are _parameter names_
(e.g _x_, _y_, _height_, _width_, and _fill_) and the values are _encoding functions_.

Encoding functions have the following signature:

- **_encode_(_ctx_: MarkEncodingContext)**

  _MarkEncodingContext_ Properties:

  - **d**: The current datum (row) in the bound table that this mark is reflecting
  - **index**: The index of the current row in its table
  - **view**: The current available view-space
  - **[_tableName_]** Tables are included in this context by name
  - **[_scaleName_]** Scales are included in this context by name

## Axes

![Bar Chart](/images/barchart.png)

Axes are a common feature of charts where we can understand the encoding of a
dimension in the view-space. Our system provides the ability to create Axes
with a chart orientation (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that are bound to a scale.
For more information on creating scales, see the
[Client API](/documentation/apis) section.

Axes can be constructed with a variety of options, including tick and label
parameterization.

### Defining Axes

```jsx
// React API
<Axis orient={AxisOrientation.Bottom} scale="x" />
```

```js
// SceneBuilder API
axis('x', AxisOrientation.Bottom),
```

## View Nesting

A common task in charting is to divide the view-space into separate sub-charts.
There are a variety of reasons we may want to do this.

- Rendering different chart types in adjacent areas to focus on different
  aspects of the data
- Rendering a detail view and an overview to allow brush-selection of what's
  show in detail
- Data faceting and small-multiple views

<img alt="View Nesting" src="/images/view_nesting.png" height="250">

To support this, our view model supports the idea of recursively splitting
view areas based on data-faceting or manual definition using the _Group_ mark.

## Group Marks

**Group** type marks are how we split views into sub-views. Each group
instance provides a localized view-space to marks nested within it. Groups,
like any other mark type, can be bound rows in a table or defined as singleton
instances. When groups are data-bound they may optionally define a "facet"
parameter to facet the source data table.

### Singletons

Any mark be specified as a _singleton_ by not providing a table or faceting
option, in which case it is unbound to a data-table and emits only a single
item.

```js
group() /* no tabledefined */
```

### Faceting

Groups may specify a **facet** value that describes how to facet incoming data.
In this case, the data is partitioned into a set of sub-tables, each
representing a view of the source table, and one group item is emitted per each
data partition. When faceting is used, the data partition is given a name and
provided to child marks so that they can render based on the faceted view of
the data the group provides.

```jsx
// React API
<Group table="my-data" facet={{ name: 'my-data-facet', groupBy: 'category' }}>
  {/* ...children */}
</Group>
```

```js
// SceneBuilder API
group()
  .table('my-data')
  .facet({
    name: 'my-data-facet',
    groupBy: 'category',
  })
```

#### Faceting Specification Object

- **name**: The name of the facet table to provide to child-marks.
- **groupBy**: A string describing a field to use as a groupBy key*, or
  a function that returns a groupBy key* for each row of the incoming data
  set. The partition key is used to separate the data rows into different partitions.
- **transform**: A function that accepts a partition of data and performs final
  transformation before providing it to children. Clients may use this to
  define aggregation, layout-transformations, or any other augmentation that is
  necessary for child marks to render. Default is an identity function.
