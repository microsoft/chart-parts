Using a key is helpful to speed up processing in situations where there are multiple groupby fields, but a single field is sufficient to distinguish each aggregation cell. For example, for a histogram it is faster to key solely on a bin0 property, and this is safe when the bin1 property (also included as a groupby field) contains redundant information with respect to grouping. This parameter should be used carefully, and only when one is certain that the key field uniquely distinguishes all combinations of groupby field values.
