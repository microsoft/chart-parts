## Axes

![Bar Chart](/images/barchart.png)

Axes are a common feature of charts where we can understand the encoding of a
dimension in the view-space. Our system provides the ability to create Axes
with a chart orientation (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that are bound to a scale.
For more information on creating scales, see the
[Client API](/documentation/apis) section.

Axes can be constructed with a variety of options, including tick and label
parameterization.
