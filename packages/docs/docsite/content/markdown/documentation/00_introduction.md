## Introduction

_chart-parts_ is a flexible
[Grammar-of-Graphics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447)
rendering pipeline designed for application developers.

### Project Vision

In his seminal book _The Grammar of Graphics_, Leland Wilkinson envisioned a
system of charting components and data-flows to support charts. There have been
several systems that have implemented these ideas, such as
[Vega](http://vega.github.io/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/).

The vision of `chart-parts` is to support the _rendering phases_ of
Wilkinson's pipeline in a flexible, architecture-agnostic way while
dovetailing nicely with React. To date, implementations of the
_Grammar of Graphics_ have tended to exist as closed systems. While a closed
system can be useful for certain users, and for certain abstraction levels, we
believe that a closed graphical system should be built on top of an open
graphics system to allow for maximum architectural flexibility.
