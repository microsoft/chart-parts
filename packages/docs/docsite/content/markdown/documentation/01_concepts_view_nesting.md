## View Nesting

A common task in charting is to divide the view-space into separate sub-charts.
There are a variety of reasons we may want to do this.

- Rendering different chart types in adjacent areas to focus on different
  aspects of the data
- Rendering a detail view and an overview to allow brush-selection of what's
  show in detail
- Data faceting and small-multiple views

To support this, our view model supports the idea of recursively splitting
view areas based on data-faceting or manual definition.

## Group Marks

**Group** type marks are how we split views into sub-views. Each group
instance provides a localized view-space to marks nested within it. Groups,
like any other mark type, can be bound rows in a table or defined as singleton
instances. When groups are data-bound they may optionally define a "facet"
parameter to facet the source data table.

### Singletons

Any mark be specified as a _singleton_ by not providing a table or faceting
option, in which case it is unbound to a data-table and emits only a single
item.

```js
group() /* no tabledefined */
```

### Faceting

Groups may specify a **facet** value that describes how to facet incoming data.
In this case, the data is partitioned into a set of sub-tables, each
representing a view of the source table, and one group item is emitted per each
data partition. When faceting is used, the data partition is given a name and
provided to child marks so that they can render based on the faceted view of
the data the group provides.

```js
group()
  .table('my-data')
  .facet({
    name: 'my-data-facet',
    partitionOn: r => r.category,
  })
```

#### Faceting Specification Object

- **name**: The name of the facet table to provide to child-marks.
- **partitionOn**: A string describing a field to use as a _partition key_, or
  a function that returns a _partition key_ for each row of the incoming data
  set. The partition key is used to separate the data rows into different partitions.
- **transform**: A function that accepts a partition of data and performs final
  transformation before providing it to chlidren. Clients may use this to
  define aggregation, layout-transformations, or any other augmentation that is
  necessary for child marks to render. Default is an identity function.
