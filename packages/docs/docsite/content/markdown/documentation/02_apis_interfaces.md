## Interfaces

**Package**: [_@chart-parts/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html)

The key typescript interface that are used in chart-parts are defined in the
[_@chart-parts/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html) project.
These contain enumerations for potential mark values, virtual-dom
specification, and other useful definitions. If you're using TypeScript, you
may need to import types from this package in addition to either the
[_SceneBuilder_](/apidocs/client/builder/index.html) or
[_React_](/apidocs/client/react/index.html) APIs.
