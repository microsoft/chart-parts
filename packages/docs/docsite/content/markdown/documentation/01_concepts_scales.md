## Scales

Scales are a construct that allow us to translate values from a source domain
into a target domain. Practically, what this means is that we can translate
values from our data into values that are shown to users, namely screen
coordinates, colors, etc..

Scales are based on d3 scales, and assume basic familiarity with how they
operate.

Here are some resources regarding d3 scales that may he helpful:

- [d3-scale Github repository](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)
- [d3-scale-chromatic Github repository](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic)

## Supported Scale Types

These are the basic scale types supported by the system. More details about
using and creating them can be found in the [Client APIs](/documentation/apis)
documentation section.

### Quantitative

- Linear
- Log
- Pow
- Sequential
- Sqrt
- Time
- UTC

### Discrete

- band
- ordinal
- point

In our system, each created scale has a name. This allows us to reference the
scale when we are defining [mark encodings](/documentation/concepts/marks).
